[00:15.310]I don't like your little games
[00:19.860]Don't like your tilted stage
[00:23.500]The role you made me play
[00:27.040]Of the fool, no, I don't like you
[00:30.050]I don't like your perfect crime
[00:34.490]How you laugh when you lie
[00:38.280]You said the gun was mine
[00:42.100]Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
[00:45.020]But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
[00:49.060]Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
[00:52.780]I’ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
[00:56.930]I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[01:19.730]They once belonged to me
[01:23.410]You ask me for a place to sleep
[01:27.100]Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
[01:30.370]The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
[01:33.980]But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
[01:37.890]And then the world moves on but one thing's for sure
[01:41.590]Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
[01:45.340]But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
